For xDrip you need of course only xDrip profile and the task
For AAPS you need both xDrip profile / task and AAPS profile / task.

As a reminder AAPS / AndroidAPS) is used to build a closed-loop with your CGM sensor. if you have AAPS so far
not used then you only need the TASK and the profile of xDrip. Everything that has to do with AAPS you can ignore.

What you need:

In any case, you have to allow permanent notifications for xDrip and AndroidAPS, these must be visible on the status bar, from there Tasker gets the values, if you switch them off, Tasker cannot receive anything and send it to a watch face.

You need to turn off the automatic battery optimization for your smartphone. Tips can be found here. www.dontkillmyapp.com After that, 
you'll need to turn off automatic battery optimization for all apps you've installed in the guide.

Settings and permissions for AutoNotification, Tasker, and Watchmaker:

The first thing you do now in your smartphone: Settings / Apps / Autonotification then permissions. There activate all switches.
So you do the same for Watchmaker: Settings / Apps / Watchmaker / Permissions
Activate all switches here as well
If you have all the apps installed on your smartphone, you first open AutoNotification.
 Your smartphone will start when you ask or ask for permissions when you quit AutoNotification but please accept it.
 Please also disable the battery optimization!
There you press on "Notification Interception" then on "Ignore Apps"
Here you have to check all apps except xDrip + and AAPS
You have already granted the permissions at the beginning. Another permission activates her while you set up Tasker.
AutoNotification is now set up

Very important so that Tasker gets the necessary data from AutoNotification you have to turn this on, once you have activated since then also equal all rights for Tasker equal.
I am using a Samsung smartphone with One UI when using another smartphone, this step may differ.
In addition you go in your Smartphone on Settings / Apps here you click on top right on the 3 points and click on "special access". Here you can see a list of entries that is important for the data transfer. it's about the entries

-Battery Optimize Optimize Switches for AutoNotification and Tasker DEACTIVATE

Then go to Settings / Accessibility below "Installed Services" below scroll down and activate Tasker.

Remaining Tasker permissions:
Next, open Tasker. For Tasker to work properly, please first turn the language over to English. To activate the change, press the 
3 dots on the top right to open the menu, then on Exit Tasker, then your Tasker will open directly again.
To abbreviate the whole I have created screenshots that should explain everything with questions.
To do this, after you open Tasker, click on the 3 dots in the upper right corner. The menu opens. You click on "More" then on 
"Android Settings" here you will find several entries that bring you to the permissions. You click on each entry one after the other.
Then you activate the permission by activating a switch or pressing a button. Is different for each entry.

Then Tasker is ready.

Now that all apps are set up, you can now import the required Tasker profiles and tasks. You have to be careful to import 
everything in the right order. Always first the task and then the associated profile.
You click on the link for the task, then an internet page opens. On this you will find a green button with the inscription
"IMPORT" if you pressed it you will be forwarded to Tasker. Here you will be asked if you want to import the task or the
profile and then activate it immediately. You click on both "YES" You do that with everyone

FOR TIME SMARTWATCHES IMPORTANT!
You still need to make a few adjustments on the clock. To do this, tap twice on the Watchface. Now the settings open. You can tell 
by the fact that an arrow appears on the left and right. Go to the right to the last synchsonized Watchfaces and to the left to the 
settings.
